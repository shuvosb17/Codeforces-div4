## 🧠 How `std::string` Stores Data in Memory (C++)

Unlike the old C-style strings (`char arrays`), **C++ `std::string`** is a **class** that manages memory **automatically**.

---

### 🧩 1. **C-style strings (for comparison)**

A C-style string is simply an **array of characters** ending with a special character `'\0'` (null terminator).

Example:

```cpp
char name[] = "John";
```

Memory layout (each cell = 1 byte):
| J | o | h | n | \0 |

* The array has **5 bytes total**.
* You must manually manage memory if you resize or modify it.

---

### 🧱 2. **C++ `std::string` — What It Actually Contains**

When you use:

```cpp
string a = "apple";
```

The variable `a` is **an object of the `std::string` class**.
Internally, it contains:

* A **pointer** to dynamically allocated memory (where characters are stored).
* A **size** (number of characters in the string).
* A **capacity** (allocated memory size, which may be larger than size for efficiency).

So conceptually, it looks like this:

```
+--------------------+
| string a           |
+--------------------+
| Pointer → [a p p l e \0]  |
| Size = 5            |
| Capacity = 15 (for example) |
+--------------------+
```

> 🔹 The actual characters (`a p p l e \0`) are stored in **heap memory** (dynamically allocated).
> 🔹 The `string` object (pointer + size + capacity) is stored in the **stack** if declared as a local variable.

---

### 🧮 3. **Accessing Characters**

When you do:

```cpp
cout << a[0];
```

The compiler follows the pointer inside `a` to the heap memory and fetches the first byte (character `'a'`).

So:

* `a[0]` → `'a'`
* `a[1]` → `'p'`
  and so on.

---

### ⚙️ 4. **Memory Efficiency**

C++ strings use **dynamic memory allocation** and often implement an optimization called **Small String Optimization (SSO)**:

* If a string is **short (typically ≤15 characters)**, it is stored **directly inside the string object itself (on the stack)** — no heap allocation is needed.
* This makes short strings faster and more memory-efficient.

Example:

```cpp
string s = "cat";  // stored entirely inside the string object (no heap allocation)
string s2 = "This is a much longer sentence";  // stored in heap
```

---

### 🧭 5. **In Your Program’s Context**

In your code:

```cpp
string a, b, c;
cin >> a >> b >> c;
cout << a[0] << b[0] << c[0] << endl;
```

* Each of `a`, `b`, `c` is an **object on the stack**.
* When the user types input (like `"apple banana cherry"`):

  * Each word is stored dynamically (likely on the heap).
  * The object keeps track of its own size and capacity.
* When you access `a[0]`, you’re reading the **first byte in the memory block** that stores that string’s characters.

---

### 🧾 6. **Visualization Example**

If user enters:

```
apple banana cherry
```

Memory might look like this (simplified):

| Variable | Stored On | Data Stored In               | Points To (Heap Data) |
| -------- | --------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `a`      | Stack     | pointer, size=5, capacity=15 | "apple\0"             |
| `b`      | Stack     | pointer, size=6, capacity=15 | "banana\0"            |
| `c`      | Stack     | pointer, size=6, capacity=15 | "cherry\0"            |

### 🧠 Summary

| Concept               | Explanation                                                                          |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Storage Type**      | `std::string` stores characters dynamically (usually on the heap).                   |
| **Internals**         | Maintains pointer, size, and capacity.                                               |
| **Access**            | Uses indexing to fetch characters from the underlying array.                         |
| **Optimization**      | Short strings may use Small String Optimization (stored directly inside the object). |
| **Memory Management** | Automatically handled — no need for manual allocation or freeing.                    |

## 🧩 Problem Title

**B. First Letters Extraction**

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

After completing this problem, the learner will be able to:

1. **Manipulate strings efficiently** in C++ and understand how to access specific characters using index notation.
2. **Handle multiple test cases** and perform repeated operations using loops.
3. **Apply string input/output operations** effectively with `cin` and `cout`.
4. **Understand the use of arrays or string indexing** (`string[index]`) for direct character access.
5. **Develop concise logic** to extract and display specific parts of input data.

---

## ⚙️ Approach

### 1. **Problem Understanding**

* You are given **three words** (`a`, `b`, and `c`) in each test case.
* The goal is to **print the first character** of each word, concatenated together, on a single line.

For example, if the inputs are:
`apple banana cherry` → Output: `abc`

---

### 2. **Concept Used**

* Each string stores a word.
* The **first character** of each word can be accessed using `string[0]`.
* The program repeats this process for all test cases.

---

### 3. **Algorithm Steps**

1. **Input** number of test cases `t`.
2. Repeat the following for `t` times:

   * Read three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   * Print the first character of each string without spaces (`a[0]`, `b[0]`, `c[0]`).
3. Move to the next line after printing each result.

---

### 4. **Time and Space Complexity**

* **Time Complexity:** O(t) — since each test case performs constant-time operations.
* **Space Complexity:** O(1) — only a few strings are stored.

---

### 5. **Example Walkthrough**

**Input:**

```
3
apple banana cherry
hello world code
sun moon star
```

**Processing:**

| a     | b      | c      | Output |
| ----- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| apple | banana | cherry | abc    |
| hello | world  | code   | hwc    |
| sun   | moon   | star   | sms    |

**Output:**

```
abc
hwc
sms
```

---

### 6. **Final C++ Code**

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    string a, b, c;

    for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
        cin >> a >> b >> c;
        cout << a[0] << b[0] << c[0] << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## 🧾 **Conclusion**

By solving this problem, the learner gains a practical understanding of:

* Accessing characters within strings using indexing.
* Managing multiple test cases in a loop.
* Writing clean and efficient C++ programs for basic text processing.
